CodeIgniter Con 2010 is the first all-CodeIgniter conference and is being run in the UK. This means anyone who couldn't make it to San Francisco this month for [EECI2010](http://eeci2010.com/) will be able to "get their nerd on" with some well known CI developers. The conference will be great for people new to CI wanting to learn and experienced developers who may want to pick up some new tricks or just meet fellow nerds.

Unlike many conferences we have worked hard to make sure that ticket prices are affordable for everyone. A slightly cheaper venue has been used but it is still a great location. This means we can offer tickets at £20 for the speaker orientated Day 1, and £10 for the Workshop Day 2.

Another big appeal of CICON2010 is that EECI2010 has dropped it's "CI Track" which means that there will be no more "CI based web development", instead focusing only on ExpressionEngine and EE-centric CodeIgniter development. So if you want to learn about CodeIgniter and don't care about making EE add-ons, this is your best bet.

For a full list of speakers, talk topics and other information pop over to the [CICON2010 website](http://www.cicon2010.com/ "CodeIgniter Conference UK").
