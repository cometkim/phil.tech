excerpt: That title may be misleading but I just couldn't help myself... Puns aside,
  I decided it was time to write a nice clean cURL library for CodeIgniter to help
  with your automated browsing and remote page requests.

I noticed a support request for a cURL related question and decided it was time CI had its own cURL library. After a few hours of blind coding on a box with no cURL extension, I posted a solution that brilliantly enough worked first time (score!). When I got home the user posting the request pointed out that [Alex Poloski](http://alexpolski.com/) had already [made one](http://alexpolski.com/2008/04/13/curl-library-for-codeigniter/).

Ahh well, my wheel is better!

To take a look at my new-fangled [cURL library](http://codeigniter.com/wiki/Curl_library/) take a look at its page on the [CodeIgniter Wiki](http://codeigniter.com/wiki/)
