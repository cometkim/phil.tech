To get this working is very easy. Constants can be seen all the way through CodeIgniter and can be set almost anywhere. To keep things neat and logical we will put this code into `application/config/constants.php`.

For a simple 2 environment switch you can use the following:

~~~php
define('ENV', strpos($_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'], 'local') !== FALSE ? 'local' : 'live');
~~~

Or if you have more than the two environments:

~~~php
if(strpos($_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'], 'local') !== FALSE) { 
  define('ENV', 'local');
} elseif(strpos($_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'], 'dev.') === 0) { 
  define('ENV', 'dev');
} elseif(strpos($_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'], 'qa.') === 0) {
  define('ENV', 'qa');
} else { 
  define('ENV', 'live');
}
~~~

That will match:  

- `http://localhost/` = local
- `http://local.example.com/` = local
- `http://dev.example.com/` = dev
- `http://qa.example.com/` = qa
- `http://example.com/` = live

Now you can base your config on `if (ENV == 'live')`. This is helpful for setting the `$active_group` in `database.php`, running caching for live only, displaying profiler and debug data for local/dev only and plenty more.
