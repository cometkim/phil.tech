title: ExpressionEngine 2.0 can finally have a Rest
category: 
alias: blog/2010/07/expressinengine2-rest/
excerpt: My first ExpressionEngine 2.0 Add-on has been released, with the amazingly
  imaginative name "Rest". You can use it to integrate RESTful API's into your ExpressionEngine
  2.0 website. You can list Tweets, search for Digg articles, show off Flickr photographs
  and interact with any open RESTful API.

My first ExpressionEngine 2.0 Add-on has been released, with the amazingly imaginative name "Rest". I originally had the idea for this module at EECI2009 but never quit got around to it. After playing around with a few ideas in the run-up to EECI2010 I had the chance to come up with something that I felt would work nicely. After some encouraging words from some of the EE and CI guys I decided to press on, and voila!

<object style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="600" height="383" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0">
<param name="loop" value="false">
<param name="quality" value="high">
<param name="src" value="http://blip.tv/play/g7lmgerREgA.m4v">
<embed style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="600" height="383" src="http://blip.tv/play/g7lmgerREgA.m4v" loop="false" quality="high" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"></embed>
</object>

For an example of how this all works, you can have a [look here]({page_url(24)} "ExpressionEngine 2.0: Rest") at the code page or  [buy this module](http://devot-ee.com/addons/rest/) now from Devot:ee for a very reasonable $30.

I'm really excited to have finally released a module and initial feedback has been positive. Yet another item I can cross off my list of [goals for 2010]({page_url(17)} "Goals").

Let me know what you think of the module and I'll be happy to take any feedback into consideration. v1.1 is already underway with authentication support and improved support for Delicious (and dodgy HTTPS setups in general).
