While I am on the ignite100 start-up incubator I have met some amazing people in some brilliant start-ups. One of these start-ups is [Givey](http://www.givey.co.uk/): a "social giving platform" which allows donations via SMS, Twitter, etc. They have organised an event happening in Newcastle tonight called [Stitch Your Friends Up](http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2467179400) where a few people will be brought up on stage and be "Stitched Up" for money. Of course muggins here is involved and you can be too. I am sworn to secrecy on everybody else, but basically put for every £10 that is raised - at the event or via Twitter by users watching the live stream - I will have one strip of wax removed from my leg. Yep you heard it. You can cause me pain in real time and see the results!

If you are interested in contributing to my pain, I will be raising money for [Homeless International](http://www.homeless-international.org/) which do some great work helping to improve the quality of life for people living in slums in Asia and Africa. They provide training in water and sanitation, work to secure land for people living there and basically give them a voice. This is some great work and I am all for it, so much so that I am donating my leg hair to the event.

All you have to do is sign up to Givey and associate your Twitter account, then tweet - where 1 = £1:

<blockquote>#GIVEY @philsturgeon 1</blockquote>

Alternatively you can send SMS donations:

<blockquote>88008: GIVEY PHIL 1</blockquote>

The donations are only open between 7:00-8:00pm GMT and you can watch the live-streaming here powered by [Bambuser](http://bambuser.com/) which streams straight to your mobile so even if you're on the bus you have no excuse to miss this horrible/hilarious event:

I'm not allowed to say what the others are doing and to be honest I don't know some, but I do know that it's going to be very funny. If you're in Newcastle tonight then stop by, there are still tickets, it's free and we'll be having a few drinks afterwards.
