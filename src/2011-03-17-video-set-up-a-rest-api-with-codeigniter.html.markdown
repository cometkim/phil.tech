title: 'Video: Set up a REST API with CodeIgniter'
category: codeigniter
alias: blog/2011/03/video-set-up-a-rest-api-with-codeigniter/
excerpt: " Tonight I started working on the RESTful API for PancakeApp - an invoicing
  system built in CodeIgniter - when I remembered how many people have been asking
  for help using REST_Controller. I wrote up an article on NetTuts last year hoping
  that would cover the majority of questions, but with new features like API Keys,
  Limiting and Logging being added I thought a quick run-through was in order. This
  video covers the basic implementation, HTTP Basic/Digest authentication, format
  switching and goes onto the new API Key and logging features. As this is an admittedly
  an unplanned video I'll be accepting answers to the question \"How many mistakes
  did I make?\" on the back of a postcard. \n"

Tonight I started working on the RESTful API for [PancakeApp](http://pancakeapp.com/) - an invoicing system built in CodeIgniter - when I remembered how many people have been asking for help using REST_Controller. I wrote up an article on NetTuts last year [Working with RESTful Services in CodeIgniter](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/php/working-with-restful-services-in-codeigniter-2/) hoping that would cover the majority of questions but with new features like API Keys, Limiting and Logging being added I thought a quick run-through was in order. This video covers the basic implementation, HTTP Basic/Digest authentication, format switching and goes onto the new API Key and logging features.

As this is an admittedly an unplanned video I'll be accepting answers to the question "How many mistakes did I make?" on the back of a postcard. It's surprising how much time can go into screencasts, even bad ones!
