It has just come to my attention that PHP 5.3 will include the " [goto](http://us.php.net/goto)" keyword that exists in so many other programming languages.

PHP 5.3 adds some great features such as lambda functions, namespaces and class constants, but this new feature in my eyes is a massive step backwards for PHP and for all of us charged with the duty of maintaining other peoples code.

The question I wish to ask, is ["Will you use goto in your PHP when 5.3 is released?"](http://twtpoll.com/e9pghw). Click to vote in the [twtpoll](http://twtpoll.com/).
