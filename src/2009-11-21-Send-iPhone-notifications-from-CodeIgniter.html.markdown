Most web-applications currently use automated e-mail's to let an administrator know something is going on and some applications use Twitter. Why not use iPhone Push Notifications to get an alert to you immediately without having to check a thing?

If you know nothing about how Push Notifications work then relax, you really don't need to. [Prowl](http://prowl.weks.net/ "Prowl is the Growl client for the iPhone OS.") handles it all for you and gives you access to a simple API once you have registered an account.

The day Prowl was released I felt the need to make something with it, no matter how simple or silly. The result was [Spam Phil](/spamphil/). That was some time ago and recently the comical spams have died out, but I was reminded of this work when a follower on Twitter asked for my Prowl work "@philsturgeon any chance you could email me the source of your little Codeigniter + Prowl integration?".

I was slightly confused as I had never done any CodeIgniter + Prowl work, but not wanting to disappoint, I threw one together based on PHP Prowl.

The installation and useage is really simple, take a look here:

If it makes your iPhone explode, blame somebody else.
