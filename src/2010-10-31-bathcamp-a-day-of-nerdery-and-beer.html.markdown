I have been to several conferences, unconferences and local BathCamp meets, but this years proper BathCamp was a real chuckle. BathCamp is BarCamp event which is basically a bunch of web geeks, some lightning talks, throw in some pizza, a free bar, some Family Fortunes and a lot of tweed and you've got the general idea. This years event came at a great timing with recently starting to learn Ruby as I got to speak with a lot of other Ruby geeks while I was there and see Elliot Kember in action smashing a few crazy little applications out at great speed.

BathCamp generally encourages everyone to give a talk but I've had no time to prepare anything recently what with [PyroCMS](http://pyrocms.com/), [FuelPHP](http://fuelphp.com/), [PancakeApp](http://pancakeapp.com/), [DesignSVN](http://designsvn.com/) and god knows how many other projects going on. Instead myself, [Alex Bilbie](http://alexbilbie.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/), [Elliott Kember](http://elliottkember.com/), [Nick jackson](http://twitter.com/#!/jacksonj04) and some guy called Dave decided to perform a rendition of Daft Punk's Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger using RFID bracelets, two readers and a some of Elliott's "mad-dog" Ruby skills.

One of my favourite talks was from a new Bath local: [Jack Fracklin](http://twitter.com/jack_franklin). He gave a talk on jQuery which lead me to learn a new phrase: "slideshow rape". HA! Some genius (not me as he first thought) made a very subtle change in one of his examples from "some title" to say "some tits", which really knocked the otherwise confident little bugger for six.

Elliott Kember was chased by a flying iPhone controlled robot, so much Pizza was eaten that Bath is still suffering a pizza shortage, sugar-filled vitamin water was consumed in such large quantity that I think most of us are now diabetic and I ended up pissed as a fart as usual.

In all? A bloody good day, all thanks to the bearded "Tweed Wonder" that is [Julian Cheal](http://twitter.com/#!/juliancheal). Good work!
