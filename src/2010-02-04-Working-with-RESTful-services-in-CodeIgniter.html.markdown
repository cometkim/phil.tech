This blog has been pretty quiet for a few weeks now, mainly because I have been working on a beast of an article for NetTuts called " [Working with RESTful services in CodeIgniter](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/php/working-with-restful-services-in-codeigniter-2/ "NetTuts Tutorial explaining how to work with REST in CodeIgniter")".

It is a great feeling to finally get an article on a site as large as NetTuts and hopefully it is the first of several. I have a few ideas for more articles, but of course I will keep posting the smaller ones here.

Even nerds need money for food. ;-)
