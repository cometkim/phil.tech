Two months ago I was doing some client work that ended up with me [creating NinjAuth](/blog/2011/09/ninjauth-social-integration-php) - a generic authentication layer between [FuelPHP](http://fuelphp.com/)'s auth package and social networks via OAuth, OAuth 2 and OpenID. I've been working on it a fair bit on and off since then and in the last week I've ported it to CodeIgniter for use with PyroCMS and it's looking brilliant! You can now use PyroCMS to drive your social site. Login and register with Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, YouTube, Tumblr, etc, attach multiple accounts to users, post blog articles to Facebook and much more on the way.

Here's a video:

I'll be working on this some more and releasing it shortly after PyroCMS 2.0 final is released, but I got a bit excited and wanted to show it off to people. I have a few more kick-ass modules and features coming out for PyroCMS shortly and it's become one hell of a platform.

Within the next few months I'm expecting an iPhone app, inline-editing and an in-Control Panel Add-on Store where people can browse addons and install with one-click. The more copies of add-ons and PyroCMS I can sell the more fun features like these I get to work on, so thanks to everyone supporting me and [HappyNinjas](http://happyninjas.com/) to make fun stuff!
