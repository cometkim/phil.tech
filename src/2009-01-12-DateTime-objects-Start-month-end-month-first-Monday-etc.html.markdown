I recently came across PHP's [DateTime](http://uk3.php.net/manual/en/class.datetime.php) object and I'm loving it.

~~~php
// Calculate month and year to look for
$month = !empty($_GET['month']) ? $_GET['month'] : date('m');
$year = !empty($_GET['year']) ? $_GET['year'] : date('Y');

// Start of the month
$start_date = new DateTime($year.'-'.$month.'-01');

// End of the month
$end_date = new DateTime( $start_date->format('Y-m-d') );
$end_date->modify('+1 month -1 day');

echo ' Start: '. $start_date->format('d m Y');
echo ' End: '. $end_date->format('d m Y');
~~~

Working out the first Monday of the month is also quite easy, but has one slight complication. If Monday is on the 1st, the modifier "first monday" will look for the next Monday AFTER that, meaning the 8th.

~~~php
$first_monday = new DateTime($start_date->format('Y-m-d'));
if($first_monday->format('l') != 'Monday') $first_monday->modify('first monday');
~~~

DateTime may have been around for a while now, but it's still not fully documented or even entirely complete on any of the PHP set-ups I have tried it on. Still waiting on `DateTime::diff()`.
