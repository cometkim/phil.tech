Now normally when I do big jobs I like to use CodeIgniter but at work that is not an option. Instead I had to get these sections working using the same codebase as the rest of the company site on a subdomain, which was last done 2 or 3 years ago. It seems everyone who was around in the company then had either forgotten how, or had no idea!

Well after weeks of struggling with Apache config files, CNAME rules, tricky redirects and seemingly never ending change requests, the sites are live!

- **[MSN Money UK - Funds](http://funds.money.uk.msn.com/)**
- **[MSN Money UK - Pensions](http://pensions.money.uk.msn.com/)** 
- **MSN Money UK - Currency _<small>Coming Soon</small>_** 

Will be a nice bullet point to go on my CV methinks.
