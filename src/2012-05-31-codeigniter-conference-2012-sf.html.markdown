  CodeIgniter by developers trying to win my iPad. Then we had CICONF2012 in London,
  and now it's off to San Francisco for more CodeIgniter nerdery.

So only two months until the return of CICONF to America! Last year was [CICONF2011](http://cicon2011.com) NY which was a great experience. There we announced the availability of CodeIgniter on GitHub, released CodeIgniter 2.1-dev and saw over 50 pull requests get made to CodeIgniter by developers trying to win my iPad. Then we had [CICONF2012 in London](http://ciconf.com/uk/2012), and now it's off to San Francisco for more CodeIgniter nerdery.

There are going to be more great speakers this year, including some attendees from last year which is great to see!Â 

- Aaron Kuzemchak
- Ben Edmunds
- Calvin Froedge
- Erik Giberti
- John Crepezzi
- John Corry
- Keeny Katzguru

Also, I'll be giving a talk too. As with many conferences the exact talk details are yet to be finalised, but we all have very exciting topics in mind. In London we learned about unit testing in CI, API driven development, using ORMs (and why they aren't evil) and amongst other things we saw a few developers how you can use CI to speed up your workflow. This year will be similar, but you won't have to listen to as many British people (which I know can be hard work!).

I have a few fun announcements to make, games to host and prizes to give away, which is always a pleasure. If you aren't there you will certainly be missing out.
