After years of being an active member in the CodeIgniter community I have decided it is time to change things up and move on. Where is that move taking me? Recently I have been doing a lot of research into various frameworks and I have made a final decision.

### Why the move?

I am bored of CodeIgniters simplicity and fed up with how FuelPHP has made development way too easy and logical. Development is meant to be a challenge, but both of these frameworks make things so easy that programming has started to bore me to death. I need a challenge, I need something that will constantly keep me guessing and I want to work with random auto-magic in a Rails-like way, but without having to go and learn a new language. PHP is the best thing in the world right, so why learn anything else if I could just use a framework that has blindly ported some of the features in?

### So which framework?

There can be only one answer here and that is CakePHP. The main thing I love about this framework is that it _ **really** _makes you think long and hard about performance and caching. CodeIgniter is so lightweight that you end up getting lazy and pay no attention to the benchmarks. CakePHP has the heaviest base of any framework around, so what better way to make you focus on efficiency! I'll go back to those fun nights of trying to squeeze that last 5% of efficiency out of an application, but now instead of creating a massive CMS or a video encoding API, I can have those performance tuning nights on a basic brochure site. Winner!

Keep an eye out for developments and tutorials as I go along this path. It should be a blast.
