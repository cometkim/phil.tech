After writing about how [GraphQL and REST differ](https://phil.tech/api/2017/01/24/graphql-vs-rest-overview/) in various regards, and taking a closer look at [caching in particular](https://phil.tech/api/2017/01/26/graphql-vs-rest-caching/), I wanted to write about how you can get some of the benefits of GraphQL into an existing endpoint-based API.

It's finally live, and over on the [Runscope blog](https://blog.runscope.com/posts/you-might-not-need-graphql).

Normally I'd post this sort of thing on here, but I've got a [smashed racing bike to pay for](https://phil.bike/unexpected-upgrade-supersix-evo-aa37b67daa08), Runscope are awesomely generous with their rates, and they didn't meddle with the article in the slightest - other than defeating the usual bevy of typos.

This article aims to highlight the fact that a lot of what is popular about GraphQL is not actually new. That's not to shit-talk GraphQL, but OData covers a lot of the same concepts (with a less lovely syntax), SOAP was doing a lot of this and getting a bad wrap, and - as was pointed out in the comments - SPARQL had a good go at the whole "standardisation" thing GraphQL fans keep touting about their new fave query language.
