  title: "API Descriptions as Production Code"
  short: >
      Lots of developers are aware they can use API descriptions for docs and
      mocking, but they often have this concern about “keeping specs in sync with
      code”. Learn how to reuse these description docs to drastically simplify
      validation, in client-side, server-side, and even at the API gateway.

  title: "Automating API Style Guides"
  short: >
      Creating consistent, quality APIs is a tough job, especially as ecosystems
      move past 100 APIs and beyond. API Style Guides can help, but developers
      rarely read them, and those that do don't always remember everything.
      API Design Reviews and Governance tooling is maturing to help solve this,
      automating API Style Guides allowing teams to introduce new guidance over time. Learn
      how to roll this out at your company easily.

    HTTP Caching is something many people have heard of, and usually know a bit about but skip implementing in any
    real way. Browsers are expected to do everything correctly by default, and backend systems don’t bother because
    Redis Caching is apparently fine... Well it’s not. Balancing real-time information and avoiding making
    unnecessary requests isn’t a pipe dream, and there are plenty of tools out there to help you get it done
    right now.

  title: What Rails Can Teach PHP About Building APIs
  short: >
    As somebody who's built APIs with PHP since 2009, and built APIs with Rails for the last two years, the contrast
    in some of the tooling available is mind-blowing. Generating test data, spec-driven testing, simplistic state
    machines, serialization and deserialization in JSON-API, REPL debugging with breakpoints, file upload handlers,
    etc.

    It is amazing, and I'll explain why, but they're two different things, used for different things!
