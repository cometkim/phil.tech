This blog has been a bit quiet for the last two years, with me blogging on [APIs
You Won't Hate](https://apisyouwonthate.com/blog) and
[phil.bike](https://philk.bike) more than here.

2017 was mostly spent putting out fires at WeWork as an API designer and
architect, helping to debug and stabilize their tightly coupled [deathstar
architecture](https://developer.ibm.com/courses-center/business-service-microservices-dependencies-death-star-dwc024/),
which was [constantly
crashing](https://apisyouwonthate.com/blog/taking-a-timeout-from-poor-performance)
for pretty much no reason, with absolutely zero fault-tolerance anywhere.

A lot of 2018 was spent trying to figure out a good workflow for API
specifications, as there was zero documentation there and nobody had a clue how
anything worked. This lead to people [building out new
endpoints](/blog/api-versioning-has-no-right-way) for every new client because
they were scared to try and use the old ones, which slowed down projects, and
wasted significant amount of money.

The workflow had to cover prototyping, docs, mocks, contract testing, and after
a lot of research, open-sourcing, and team-work, we [figured it
out](https://apisyouwonthate.com/blog/weworks-api-specification-workflow). The
2nd half of 2018 was spent getting people on board with it, one team at a time.
It wasn't hugely exciting work, but all the nonsense happening at WeWork gave me
enough content to start writing [two
books](https://www.apisyouwonthate.com/books) at the same time! ðŸ¤£

I started focusing heavily on cyclocross training, moving out of NYC and [living
in random houses all around the tri-state
area](https://phil.bike/escape-from-new-york/). For all of Autumn I was living
for the weekend, and racing every day I could.

After a month of top 10s and consistent progress I managed to place [4/120 in a
big race in DC](https://phil.bike/2018-dccx/), then immediately got bronchitis
and pneumonia and was just fucking useless at bikes for the rest of cross
season, pootling around pointlessly racking up miles until December.

That's when it became clear it was time for a change. I'd been talking to
[Stoplight](http://stoplight.io/) loads as I was trying to figure out how their
tooling could be worked into my API Design First workflow, and one day I just
asked if they had a place for me on the team. The response was "yeah we'd been
meaning to ask but weren't sure how to bring it up!" and the most natural hiring
ever happened.

So I handed in my notice at WeWork in January, sold all my stuff, gave Stowford
the turtle to a racing mate, went riding bikes in the [Canary
Islands](https://phil.bike/canary-islands-tenerife-gran-canaria/) all February
to unwind. Since March I have been working remotely for Stoplight, whilst [riding across
Europe](https://phil.bike/euro-trip-two-months/).

It's been going just as ridiculously as you might expect.

I will continue to split writing between here and the other blogs, focusing on
things directly bikes on phil.bike, education API things on [APIs You Won't
Hate](https://apisyouwonthate.com/blog), and anything else tech related on here.

I'm extremely excited about what is coming up at
[Stoplight](http://stoplight.io/). It's such an amazing fit. I'll be talking
about them a lot going forward. Not because I work there now and so I should
probably say they are the best API Design Management solution, I joined them
because they are the best API Design Management solution.

Stoplight support open-source in so many ways I want to blog about it as a model for
other companies, and let me work on JSON Schema and OpenAPI contributions as
part of my job. ðŸ˜²

Give it another month or two and you'll be tired of scooping your jaw off the
floor at what we're building. ðŸ™Œ

_Also whilst I'm cycling around I'm trying to raise awareness about how [easy and beneficial
carbon offsetting can be](https://phil.bike/trees)._
