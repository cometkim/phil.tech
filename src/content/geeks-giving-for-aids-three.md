For the third time, I will be doing a three-day ride from Boston to New York, along with hundreds of amazing people. Everyone was in various levels of fitness and with various levels of interest in cycling, but everyone had come together with the aim of helping raise a shitload of money to help those living with HIV/Aids.

Two years in a row, a bunch of the tech community jumped on board together to raise [almost $6,000 one year](http://fundraising.housingworks.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=portal.home&participantID=1212) and [$5,325 another year](http://fundraising.housingworks.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=portal.home&participantID=2035).

Once again I have enlisted the help of my author/business-owner friends to offer donation rewards. I know you're all nice people and want to donate money to any cause that will stop people from suffering, but sometimes getting something back in return can help you fit that donation into your budgets.

There are some awesome rewards in here, and a few copies of my book of course:

**$10** - Any _one_ of the following:

* A free copy of [_Build APIs You Won't Hate_](http://apisyouwonthate.com/) eBook
* A free copy of [_The Majesty Of Vue.js_](https://leanpub.com/vuejs) eBook

**$25** - Any _one_ of the following:

* A free copy of _[Scaling PHP](https://www.scalingphpbook.com/)_ eBook
* 50% off of any _[Grumpy Learning](http://grumpy-learning.com/)_ eBooks
* 50% off a copy of [_Servers for Hackers_](https://leanpub.com/serversforhackers) eBook

**$200** - Any _one_ of the following:

* One hour of Skype consultation on API design, API testing, PHP, Rails, managing services, whatever, from meeee

Interested? [Make a donation](http://fundraising.housingworks.org/participant/philsturgeon-2016).

Help me help other people. $5k is a huge amount of money, and I've only got a few weeks to get it done.

All the money sent via that portal goes straight to the charity, and they have a huge number of volunteers keeping costs of the ride the lowest I've seen. They even keep their modeling costs down by using us riders to strike a pose!

![I agreed to take this daft photo if y'all got me to $5k last year. This time there will be a lovely photo of me riding in a red cocktail dress.](img/2016-09-08-geeks-giving-for-aids-three/handsome-as-fuck.jpg)

It's an amazing group of people, and I'm excited to be riding with them again. We have big goals to hit and we need you to help.
