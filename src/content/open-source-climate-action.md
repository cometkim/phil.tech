Listening to the climate fix amazing how many ideas are out there https://theclimatefix.com/episodes

The excellent Laura Hilliger was writing about this in 2019.

Green cron. Google data centers shift machine learning and business information jobs to low carbon times (usually cheaper). Bring this concept to others, even if itâ€™s not effecting the costs of your server.

## Free Ideas

Pointless Roads. Create software that looks at maps, identifies stretches of road which have equally valid alternatives within X% travel time. Arm councils and/or activists with this tool. If there's a house at each end we could dig the middle up and plant a bunch of trees, or turn it into a bike road with access-only and huge fines for driving through it otherwise.

AbandonWare. Look for entirely abandoned bits of land by machine learning on free satellite images, comparing as many versions of the same bit of land as possible, to see if things are changing there or not. It takes any possible hits and runs it through a local land database, which finds out who owns it, or what is going on. Then a human can give them a call and see if they'd be into reforesting it, or doing something more useful than having an empty field sitting about. My charity could buy it. 

GreenBay. Make a market place where people can sell things, maybe using other existing open-source marketplaces as a base, where the only form of payment is trees or tonnes or CO2, using the [Ecology API](TODO) or the [Patch API](TODO).


climateaction.tech and https://techimpactmakers.com/ are a good place to start
